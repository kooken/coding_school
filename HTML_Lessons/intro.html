		It must have been late in the afternoon one day at the end of August when Moomintroll and his mother arrived at
		the deepest part of the great forest. It was completely quiet, and so dim between the trees that it was as
		though twilight had already fallen. Here and there giant flowers grew, glowing with a peculiar light like
		flickering lamps, and furthest in among the shadows small, cold green points moved.

	<p> "Why is that?" asked Moominmamma.

		"Oh, because that’s where the Great Serpent lives," said the small creature in a very low voice, looking about
		him in all directions.</p>
